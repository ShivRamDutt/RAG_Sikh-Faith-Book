# RAG Model for Sikh Faith Book

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model for processing and analyzing text from a Sikh faith book. The RAG model reads a PDF of the book, feeds it into the model, and retrieves responses to specific queries based on the content.

## Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Model**: Combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to answer questions about the Sikh faith book.
- **PDF Processing**: Extracts and processes text from a PDF file of the Sikh faith book.
- **Query Response**: Provides answers to queries by leveraging the information extracted from the book.

## Requirements

To run the Jupyter Notebook, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.9
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
